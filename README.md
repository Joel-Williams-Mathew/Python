<h3 align="left">Python Use Cases</h3>
1) Creating web applications on a server
2) Building workflows that can be used in conjunction with software
3) Connecting to database systems
4) Reading and modifying files
5) Performing complex mathematics
6) Processing big data
7) Fast prototyping
8) Developing production-ready software

Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Developers also use Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps.

<h3 align="left">Features and Benefits of Python</h3>
1) Compatible with a variety of platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and others.
2) Uses a simple syntax comparable to the English language that lets developers use fewer lines than other programming languages.
3) Operates on an interpreter system that allows code to be executed immediately, fast-tracking prototyping.
4) Can be handled in a procedural, object-orientated, or functional way.
